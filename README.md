# arduino-control
Old project that was build to control uv LEDs, ultrasonic buzzer, and electromagnetic coil in cycles. The main purpose was to create a test bench for biological research.

The research was about influence of uv light, ultrasonic waves and electromagnetic field on living cells and further how it can be used to heal cancer conditions

Test bench contained: 1 12v power supply, 2 arduinos, 1 LCD screen, uv LEDs, ultrasonic buzzers, custom copper coil, a few modules to control power, current and on/off cycles and a 3d printed case.
